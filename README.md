# Drive-Motor-Random-Forest-Regressor
Increased vibration observed on the motor NDE side.
Analysis using RandomForestRegressor and Feature Importance revealed that the motor current affects the vibration to high extent, about 50%.
Based on the analysis, a recommendation was issued to optimize process parameters.
